## Analysis Dimensions
1. **Explicit Intent**: The intent the user clearly expresses (e.g., "analyze the market" = research type)
2. **Implicit Intent**: Steps the user didn't explicitly mention but actually needs (e.g., "write a report" implies data collection)
3. **Composite Intent**: Whether the request contains multiple independent research subtasks
4. **Ambiguity**: Whether the request is clear enough or needs clarification
5. **Complexity**: Evaluate based on analysis dimensions, data requirements, reasoning depth

## Capabilities
The system supports the following research capabilities - identify which ones the user needs:
- **Industry Research / Company Research**: Industry analysis, company profiling, competitive landscape
- **Survey Design**: Design and distribute questionnaires, collect responses, analyze survey data
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis, data visualization, trend analysis on structured data
- **Market Analysis**: Market sizing, market trends, policy analysis, technology research

## Output Requirements
- Strictly output in JSON format, do not include any extra text
- confidence is a decimal between 0-1
- hidden_requirements lists steps the user didn't explicitly mention but actually needs
- ambiguity is only filled when the request is truly ambiguous, otherwise empty string
- core_question: distill the user's request into one central research question (e.g. "what factors will drive China's corn price trends in 2026?")

## Composite Intent Detection

When the request contains multiple independent research subtasks:
- Set "is_composite": true
- Include "sub_intents" array
- Include "orchestration_strategy": "sequential" | "hybrid" | "parallel"

## domain_context Required Keys

Always include these keys in "domain_context" when available:
- "topic": the research topic string
- "aspects": array of specific research aspects/directions
- "geographic_scope": geographic scope if mentioned
- "time_range": time range if mentioned

## section_data_specs Generation

For each research section, generate structured data specifications describing what data each section needs:

    "section_data_specs": [
      {
        "section_id": "section_0",
        "name": "Financial Analysis",
        "sub_sections": [
          {
            "sub_section_id": "sub_0_0",
            "name": "Revenue & Profitability",
            "data_needs": ["营收", "净利润", "毛利率", "净利率"],
            "data_source_type": "structured"
          },
          {
            "sub_section_id": "sub_0_1",
            "name": "Market Position",
            "data_needs": ["市场份额", "竞争格局"],
            "data_source_type": "search"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

Rules for `data_source_type`:
- **"structured"**: Numeric metrics available from structured data APIs (e.g., stock financial data: 营收, 净利润, 毛利率, ROE, PE, PB, 资产负债率, etc.)
- **"search"**: Qualitative or non-structured information (e.g., 竞争格局, 政策解读, 技术趋势, 行业前景)
- **"both"**: Data that benefits from both structured and search sources (e.g., 市场份额 where structured data provides numbers and search provides context)

Rules:
- Generate one `section_data_specs` entry per section in `domain_context.aspects`
- Each section must have at least one `sub_section` with non-empty `data_needs`
- `section_id` must follow the pattern `section_0`, `section_1`, etc.
- `data_needs` should be specific keywords/metrics, not vague descriptions

      "complexity": "multi",
      "confidence": 0.9,

        },

          "sub_sections": [
            {"sub_section_id": "sub_2_0", "name": "Breed Data", "data_needs": ["品种偏好", "消费金额"], "data_source_type": "search"}
          ]
        },
        {
          "section_id": "section_3",
          "name": "Spending Habits",
          "sub_sections": [
            {"sub_section_id": "sub_3_0", "name": "Spending Data", "data_needs": ["消费习惯", "月均支出"], "data_source_type": "search"}
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

## Forensic Analysis Detection

When the user's input meets ALL of the following conditions, set `primary_intent` to `"forensic_analysis"`:

1. **Question-type input**: The input asks a "why", "how", or "whether" question about a specific phenomenon
2. **Preloaded data available**: Document data has been uploaded/parsed (indicated by `file_ids` or `annual_report_data` in requirement)
3. **Answerable from data**: The question can be answered by analyzing the available document data (not requiring external information)

Examples:
- "为什么现金流增长但利润没增长？" + annual report data → forensic_analysis (question + preloaded data + answerable from financial statements)
- "公司的竞争优势是什么？" + annual report data → forensic_analysis (question + preloaded data + answerable from business description)
- "行业前景如何？" without annual report data → research (question but requires external data, not answerable from document alone)

When `primary_intent` is `forensic_analysis`, also output:
- `forensic_mode`: true
- `data_preloaded`: true
- `causal_hypotheses`: array of 3-5 initial causal hypotheses for the observed phenomenon
- `section_data_specs` with `data_source_type: "preloaded"` for data available in the document

Rules for `data_source_type` (extended):
- **"preloaded"**: Data already available in uploaded document (new type for forensic analysis)
